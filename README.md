A **React Native mobile application** for weather forecasting using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. This app allows users to search for cities and view current weather conditions and forecasts.

## Features

- **City Search**: Enter a city name to fetch weather details.
- **Current Weather**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- **5-Day Forecast**: (Optional future enhancement).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on Android and iOS devices.
- **OpenWeatherMap API Integration**: Fetch real-time weather data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **React Native Environment**:
   - Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Install React Native CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g react-native-cli

Initial commit
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.



## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
